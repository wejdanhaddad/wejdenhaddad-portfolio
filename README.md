### Built with React, GSAP, Three.js, and TailwindCSS

This is a fully interactive, 3D portfolio inspired by Awwwards-level websites — created to present my **skills, projects, and creative journey** as a **Multimedia & Web Developer**.  
It combines smooth scroll animations, 3D visuals, and modern web practices to deliver a cinematic, immersive experience.

>  Designed and developed with passion, blending technology, storytelling, and aesthetics.

> A dreamy blue themed 3D world — reflecting my calm creative energy and multimedia background.
